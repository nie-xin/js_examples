Learning JavaScript
===

I believe that JS will be next big language. So I start to following the study plan "How to learn JavaScript Properly": http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/


## Week 1 & 2 (1/10/2013 ~ 15/10/2013):

* Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. --- DONE

* Preface and Chapters 3 and 4 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. --- DONE

* Codecademy: Introduction, 2 ~ 5 --- DONE 

I have 2 days delay for this section. It's not easy to stay focus with lots of university courses. Anyway, making excuses is always easy. So I will try to catch up in next section.


## Week 3 & 4 (16/20/2013 ~ ): WTF, the book is too long, I had barely done ch5, ch6 in a month...How could you done this with all your university courses beside you?
* Read chapter 6 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. NOTE: Only read the “Understanding Objects” section. --- DONE

* Read chapters 5 and 7 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. --- ToDo

* Return to Codecademy and complete the JavaScript track by working through sections 6, 7, and 8 (Data Structures to Object 2).

* Read chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. --- ToDO

* Follow this jQuery course—it is free: http://try.jquery.com/

* Editor learning: WebStorm

* First Project—A Dynamic Quiz

###Before start
It seems that this would be a huge section -- 9 chapters reading, learning a new editor and building first js project. Hopefully I could make this.
